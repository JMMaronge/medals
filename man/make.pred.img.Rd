\title{A function to make prediction images for MEDALS}
\usage{
make.pred.img(score.img.list, path.mask.list, path.y.list, subj.id)
}
\arguments{
\item{score.img.list}{A list of sublists, where each sublist is a list of images created from the PC scores. This can be the output of make.score.img().This has to contain at least one sublist}

\item{path.mask.list}{A list of paths to the brain mask for each subject. This should be in the same order as the sublists for score.img.list}

\item{path.y.list}{A list of paths to the lesion mask for each subject. This should be in the same order as the sublists for score.img.list}

\item{subj.id}{A vector of subject identifiers.}
}
\description{
This function allows you to create prediction images from the MEDALS pipeline. This should be the last step
