Title: Performs Memory Efficient Decomposition for Analysis of Local
    neighborhood moments for Segmentation
Version: 0.2.0
Authors@R: c(person("Jacob", "Maronge", email = "jmmaronge@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre")),
  person("John", "Muschelli", role = "ctb"))
Description: medals() performs a method which can be used for segmentation by
    implementing a decomposition of the local neighborhood moments. It is memory
    efficient in the sense that only one image is read into memory at any given
    time.
